"""GRASP construction loop + anytime best-so-far (Story 3.6).

Implements Architecture §Cat 5's solver shape: a class with an injected RNG,
parameter snapshot, prepared `ContractedGraph`, and a continuously-readable
`best_so_far`. Termination handled here covers only the iter-budget; the
time-budget, stagnation, and KeyboardInterrupt branches in §Cat 5e land in
Epic 4 (Stories 4.2 / 4.3) at the CLI layer. The `progress_callback` parameter
is accepted but not yet invoked — Story 4.1 wires the throttled call.

Construction shape
==================

Each GRASP iteration builds **one** candidate route from a randomly-chosen
start node by greedy-randomized walk extension:

1. Sample a start node uniformly at random over the contracted graph's nodes
   (via the injected `numpy.random.Generator`).
2. At each step, build the restricted candidate list (RCL): the outgoing edges
   from the current node that pass the feasibility filters
   (not-yet-used + SAC cap), sorted by per-edge objective
   contribution (`d_plus_m + d_minus_m`) descending, truncated to
   `RCL_SIZE` entries.
3. Sample one edge uniformly from the RCL; append it; advance the current
   node to its `node_v`.
4. Repeat until the RCL is empty (no feasible extension); the walk emits as a
   `Solution`.

The slope floor θ (FR3) is a **route-level** constraint — the whole-route
average `(Σ d_plus_m + Σ d_minus_m) / Σ length_m` must clear θ — so it is NOT
applied per-edge during construction. It is enforced at finalization in `run()`
(`_route_slope_ok`): a partial walk may dip below θ and recover by appending a
steep climb, so greedy mid-walk pruning would wrongly discard recoverable
routes. Per-climb steepness lives in the separate `--min-climb-slope`
detection threshold (Story 4.1), upstream in stage 8.

Each completed `Solution` that clears the route-level floor is offered to a
`TopNTracker(params.n, params.j_max)`
— the same admission policy the oracle uses (`tests/integration/exhaustive_oracle.py`,
Story 3.5). This is what makes the Story 3.7 GRASP-vs-exhaustive quality
ratio apples-to-apples: identical distinctness semantics on both sides.

Walks are **edge-simple**: each `(node_u, node_v, key)` triple appears at most
once per route. Node-revisits via distinct edges are allowed (Story 3.5 oracle
contract). Strict containment (FR10) is guaranteed upstream — `contract_climbs`
cuts the contracted graph to the area before the solver sees it; no `Area`
check is performed here.

Determinism (FR29)
==================

All randomness flows through the injected `numpy.random.Generator`. No
ambient `numpy.random.seed`, no `random` stdlib usage, no time-derived seeds.
Two `GraspSolver` instances built with `numpy.random.default_rng(seed)` on
the same `ContractedGraph` and `SolverParams` produce byte-identical
`list[Solution]` results — including the edges' traversal order. The two
order-sensitive sites are pinned explicitly so this holds across Python /
networkx versions, where dict-insertion order is not a contract (see
`deferred-work.md` "Story 3.5 deferred #5"):

- **Start-node sampling** draws an index into `tuple(sorted(graph.graph.nodes))`
  (sorted once in `__init__`), so the start node depends only on the RNG, not
  on node-insertion order.
- **RCL ranking** ends in a total sort (`-objective`, then `(node_v, key)`),
  which fully determines the candidate order regardless of the order
  `nx_graph.out_edges(...)` yields edges in.
