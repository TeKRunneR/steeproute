"""REST routes for jobs (architecture-app.md §Category 8).

Thin by design: parse → store/enqueue → serialize. snake_case on the wire, no
response envelope (the resource is returned directly; errors are FastAPI's
default `{detail}` via `HTTPException`). Story 1.4 added the SSE progress stream
(`GET /jobs/{id}/events`), Story 1.5 the hard-cancel `POST /jobs/{id}/stop`, and
Story 1.6 the read-only `GET /regions` map overlay; `DELETE /jobs/{id}` (cancel
queued) arrives with Story 3.2.

The store, queue, and SSE hub are created in `main.lifespan` and read off
`app.state`.
